            <p class="pl-4">
                Refining the customer experience will be the main catalyst for our goal to innovate and deploy
                technology that drives
                core transformation and automation. Status Capital Building Society has entered an era where it is
                not only enough to be
                customer-focused but to be customer-obsessed by building technology, systems and processes designed
                to win, serve, and
                retains customers.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt-4" style="color: #2e6dc0;">2 Fraud prevention</h3>
            <p class="pl-4">
                A survey done by PwCâ€™s Global Economic Crime and Fraud Survey detects 49% of global organisations that
                have been a
                victim of fraud and financial crime. Some of the organisations that fell victim have recovered less than
                25% of fraud
                losses, demonstrating that fraud prevention is key. Status Capital Building Society is developing an
                infrastructure that
                offers a secure, holistic view across all their information to detect patterns that may indicate
                fraudulent behaviour.

            <p class="pl-4">
                The Status Capital Building Society Innovation Framework is aimed to mitigate risk, gain greater control
                over compliance
                hurdles and identify hidden risks that are hard to find, guided by the Eswatini financial regulations
                and policy
